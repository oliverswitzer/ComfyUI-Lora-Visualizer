# CI Workflow for ComfyUI-Lora-Visualizer
# 
# This workflow runs the same checks as the local `pdm ci` command:
# - Code formatting with black
# - Unit tests with pytest  
# - Code quality checks with pylint
#
# Triggers:
# - Push to main branch
# - Pull requests to main branch
# - Manual dispatch via GitHub Actions UI
#
# To run the same checks locally before pushing:
#   pdm ci
